- [vgg16.ipynb](https://github.com/xiaolng/ztf_summer_school_2025/blob/main/day4/le_study/vgg16.ipynb)
We will train vgg16 model as a binary classifier and explore how the model makes predictions by analyzing the feature maps.

- [faster_rcnn.ipynb](https://github.com/xiaolng/ztf_summer_school_2025/blob/main/day4/le_study/faster_rcnn.ipynb)
We will apply region based object detection model, FasterRCNN, to detect object in sky survey images.

- [LEsim.ipynb](https://github.com/xiaolng/ztf_summer_school_2025/blob/main/day4/le_study/LEsim.ipynb) We will simulate the evolution of light echoes (LEs) from an astrophysical transient (e.g., a supernova). These simulations help us predict how Rubin LSST will detect light echoes for historical transients in our Milky Way and nearby galaxies.
